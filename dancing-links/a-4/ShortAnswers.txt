Q1: Ensuring that everyone has a partner is a great strategy for scenarios where you want the most
    people to improve. In educational settings, we often want everyone to have a partner so that strong
    students bring others up and improving students to have a chance to interact with someone already
    greatly improved themselves. This will usually, in broad strokes, result in improvement.




Q2: In a business or product oriented industry a max weight matching can be productive. If someone
    needs something to be completed at a high level or the maximum value produced in a short time
    a max weight partnership can be productive. If you know that two people work together well you
    can assign them to meaningful tasks while allowing those who wish to work alone, or who do not
    work as well with others, can still be productive contributors.




Q3: This question is similar to the previous so I will try to come up with a different scenario. If
    you were tasked with optimizing important tasks on a shipping vessel you could use max weight
    matching to keep the ship safe and profitable. You would have a measure of weight and integer
    data points while fishing--the catch brought in--and could find teams that have high weight
    matching to rotate to profitable positions, while lower level tasks are delegated to lower
    weight partners.




Q4: If your goal is for the betterment of the group and its members a distributed weighting can be
    productive. If you were working at a smaller company like a startup or small business, you would
    want to have as many productive members as possible. Matching up to the highest weight per pair
    possible would have the best chance of moving the business forward while growing and
    developing.
