The code for maximum weighted matching was formed by shamelessly copying a C
implementation by Ed Rothberg in 1985, updating it to make it legal C++ code,
removing everything that wasn't needed for the maximum matching logic, and
cleaning up the interface a bit. The original source can be found here:

Most of the code here is taken directly from the original.

I added this to my project as a comparison against Knuth's Algorithm X via Dancing Links. This
required me to change the names of the functions to avoid naming conflicts with other parts of the
project. All other work contained in the FastMatching folder is unchanged and should be attributed
to Keith Schwarz and any other Stanford Course Staff that may have contributed to porting to C++
and Ed Rothberg as noted above.
